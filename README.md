# SNAP-benefits-by-political-party
SNAP used to be a bipartisan issue, but in the last 30 years things have changed. This project explores spending on SNAP by party.
Using benefits per person and the sitting U.S. presidents political party by year from 1969-2019, I explored the possibility that 
one party has a higher spending limit on food than the other. Although my findings suggest that democrats tend to spend more money 
on SNAP, not all of the factors are in place to give a definite answer.
